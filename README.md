Rock Paper Scissors
=================

This is a basic JavaScript game for one player. 

The player selects one of three options, Rock, Paper, or Scissors, by clicking on the symbol in the browser.

The computer generates a random selection of one of the three options.

The selections are compared and the outcome, win, lose, or draw, is generated.

The result is then displayed in a message in the browser, and the border of the option selected glows green, red or gray depending on the outcome.
